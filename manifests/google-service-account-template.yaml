# Current recommendation is to have one GSA per namespace, named k8s-NAMESPACE - it is used to keep permissions
# isolated ( namespace is the main unit of isolation in k8s) and to simplify setup.

# This config allows a Google Service Account to impersonate a Kubernetes Service Account by
# calling the 'TokenRequest' API to get audience-bound tokens equivalent with the tokens created
# by secret mounts.
# It also has permissions needed to get the configmaps for connecting to Istiod.

# In turn, the tokens can be used to access Istio and other services using KSA.
# The role is limited to the 'default' service account in the namespace.
