# Allow all system-authenticated KSAs to read the mesh config and root cert in istio-system for MCP.
# The config is indirectly available to pods via injection, no secrets inside.
# Istiod public cert is replicated in all namespaces and available - reading the one in istio-system to avoid
# replication details. In future we should be able to use this method instead of having the replication controller.
